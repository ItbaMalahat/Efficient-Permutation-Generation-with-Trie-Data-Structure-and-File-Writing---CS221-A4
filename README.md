Permutation Generator with Trie Validation
This C++ code efficiently generates permutations of characters and validates them using a trie data structure.

Features:
- Generates permutations of characters
- Utilizes trie data structure for word validation
- Prompts user for array dimensions
- Writes valid permutations to an output file

Usage:
- Compile the code using a C/C++ compiler.
- Run the executable.
- Input the dimensions of the 2D array when prompted.
- The code generates permutations, validates them with the trie, and writes valid permutations to an output file.

Applications:
- Word games
- Crossword puzzles
- Any scenario requiring efficient word generation and validation

Notes:
- Ensure the input file containing the trie structure is available.
- Modify the code to adapt to specific use cases or input requirements.
